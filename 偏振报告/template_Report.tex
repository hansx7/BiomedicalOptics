\begin{abstract}
	Polarization is a phenomenon used to describe transverse waves. In a transverse wave, the direction of the oscillation is transverse to the direction of motion of the wave, so the oscillations can have different directions perpendicular to the wave direction\cite{Avadhanulu.{1992}}.
	What a polarizer can do is to generally remove reflections, making many things look a little bit more colorful.
